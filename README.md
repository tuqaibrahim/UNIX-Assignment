Dear Professor Hufford,

I uploaded the files to the “work” folder around 5 p.m. However, after reviewing them again, I found two small errors (the two multiple files were empty, and the chromosome files did have missing data encoded with the symbol “-”), so I uploaded the corrected files to the “Assignment Unix” folder.

I am sorry for the inconvenience.

Best regards,
Tuqa
